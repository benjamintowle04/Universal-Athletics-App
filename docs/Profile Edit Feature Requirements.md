## User Permissions

- Users can edit all their profile information at any time
- Email changes require verification (since it's tied to Firebase auth)
- Users can remove their profile picture and revert to default
- Users can clear optional fields (Phone, Biography, Location)
- Users cannot edit their Firebase ID (system field)

## Business Rules

- Profile updates should be rate limited (prevent spam)
- Image uploads should be processed/optimized before storage
- Keep previous email accessible until new email is verified
- Maintain audit log of profile changes (for security)
- Profile data should be cached for performance
- All user input should be sanitized before storage

## Edge Cases to Handle

   - Save form progress locally
   - Provide retry mechanisms

2. **Image Upload**

   - Unsupported formats
   - Very large files

3. **Data Validation**

   - Invalid location data

4. **User Experience**

   - Concurrent edits from different devices
   - Session timeouts during edit

5. **Security**
   - XSS prevention in text fields
   - File upload security
   - Data sanitization
   - Input validation
